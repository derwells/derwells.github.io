Hi, I'm Derick Wells.

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the *University of the Philippines Diliman*. I spend my free time dabbling in computer vision, classical machine learning, and computer systems.

I've interned in [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/) as a Data Engineer and a Machine Learning Engineer.

For leisure, I enjoy swimming and learning the piano.
