Hi, I'm Derick Wells.

I'm a Computer Science undergrad at the [University of the Philippines Diliman](). I spend my free time dabbling in computer vision, classical machine learning, and computer systems. I have interned in [Thinking Machines Data Science]() as a Data Engineer and a Machine Learning Engineer.

For leisure, I enjoy swimming and learning the piano.
