Hi, I'm Derick Wells.

I'm a graduating computer science student at the University of the Philippines Diliman. My productive free time is spent on a mix of machine learning and computer systems.

For work, I've interned in [Thinking Machines Data Science](https://thinkingmachin.es/) as a Data Engineer and a Machine Learning Engineer. Since 2021, I've helped out in upgrading and maintaing my university's in-house LMS serving ~10k users.

I used to swim competitively but I'm much more into [bouldering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouldering) now.
